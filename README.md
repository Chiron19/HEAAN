# fpHE
fpHE is software library that implements homomorphic encryption (HE) that supports floating point operations.
This library supports approximate operations between rational numbers.
The approximate error depends on some parameters and almost same with floating point operation errors.
The scheme in this library is on the paper "Homomorphic Encryption for Arithmetic of Approximate Numbers" (https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/421.pdf).

This library does not contain bootstrapping yet, and we plan to add bootstrapping in next version.

This library is written by c++ and using NTL library (http://www.shoup.net/ntl/).
